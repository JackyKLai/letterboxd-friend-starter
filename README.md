# Letterboxd Friend Starter
A web app that filters out a Letterboxd user's csv data so that it can be imported by someone else. 

Deployed at https://jackyklai.github.io/letterboxd-friend-starter/

## Why?
I convinced my buddy Jeff to get a Letterboxd account a while back. I realized since I tag all my watches with the names of the people I saw the film with, he could just import my data and get a bit of a diary going. Also, I was bored on a Saturday. So this mess of a project exists.

## Getting Started

This is a nextjs project, so

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## So basically it just reads a CSV file and filters it?
Yep.
